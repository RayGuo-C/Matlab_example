Some useful code examples to learn or review matlab

matlab features:
    
	MATLAB is a high-level mult-paradigm computing language and interactive encironment for algorithmic development, data visualization, data analysis and numerical computation;
	
	Powerful toolbox;
	
	Easy to interface with programms written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,  Fortran and Python;
	
    However, the program execution is slower than other high-level programms due to the charateristics of interpretation.
